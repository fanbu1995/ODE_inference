# ODE_inference
Parameter estimation for ODE-based dynamical models

This repo contains R code (and some supplementary plots and saved results) for an ODE inference framework based on **linear noise approximation**

3 simulation experiments have been carried out:

- Simple exponential function (basic_functions.R)
- Stochastic logistic equation (stochastic_logistic_equation.R)
- Lotka-Volterra equation (lotka_volterra.R)
